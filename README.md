Ensure your file structure matches the following to ensure scripts can locate dependencies:

    ReplicatedStorage:

        Move the contents of ReplicatedStorage (Folders: Modules, Miscs, Events, Remotes) here.

    ServerScriptService:

        Move the contents of ServerScriptService (Scripts: CollisionFilter, ReplicateServerScript) here.

    StarterPlayerScripts:

        Move ReplicateClientScript to StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts.

    StarterPack / Workspace:

        Place the Tool folder (rename it to your gun's name) here.

> Note: The contents of folders sharing a name with a script should be parented inside that script (e.g., FastCastRedux module children go inside the FastCastRedux script).
